**WARN: (TA-976):	Path groups asserted by the group_path constraint are considered by the software to be global in nature - they cannot be restricted to specific constraint modes. Due to this restriction, the group_path constraint is not supported directly in the constraint files which are configured in mode-specific commands such as create_constraint_mode. The current group_path entry will be ignored. You can enter the group_path constraint interactively or as part of a general command script -  where it will be interpreted as global and will be in effect for all modes.

***** !! NOTE !! *****

CTS treats D-pins and I/O pins as non-synchronous pins by default.
If you want to change the behavior, you need to use the SetDPinAsSync
or SetIoPinAsSync statement in the clock tree specification file,
or use the setCTSMode -traceDPinAsLeaf {true|false} command,
or use the setCTSMode -traceIoPinAsLeaf {true|false} command
before specifyClockTree command.
