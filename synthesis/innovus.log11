CTS treats D-pins and I/O pins as non-synchronous pins by default.
If you want to change the behavior, you need to use the SetDPinAsSync
or SetIoPinAsSync statement in the clock tree specification file,
or use the setCTSMode -traceDPinAsLeaf {true|false} command,
or use the setCTSMode -traceIoPinAsLeaf {true|false} command
before specifyClockTree command.

Use setCTSMode to change default values.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Pin capacitance check

Max Cap Limit Checks
============================================================
**WARN: (IMPCK-6003):	The input capacitance of cell ICP(PAD) is 2.751pF, (timing library IO_CELLS_5V_MOS5ST_typ_1_80V_4_50V_25C is 2.751pF, macro-model definition is 0.000pF), which may make it difficult to meet max buf transition constraint. Number of gated instances having this cell type = 1.
