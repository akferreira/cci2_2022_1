***** !! NOTE !! *****

CTS treats D-pins and I/O pins as non-synchronous pins by default.
If you want to change the behavior, you need to use the SetDPinAsSync
or SetIoPinAsSync statement in the clock tree specification file,
or use the setCTSMode -traceDPinAsLeaf {true|false} command,
or use the setCTSMode -traceIoPinAsLeaf {true|false} command
before specifyClockTree command.
