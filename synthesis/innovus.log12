CTS treats D-pins and I/O pins as non-synchronous pins by default.
If you want to change the behavior, you need to use the SetDPinAsSync
or SetIoPinAsSync statement in the clock tree specification file,
or use the setCTSMode -traceDPinAsLeaf {true|false} command,
or use the setCTSMode -traceIoPinAsLeaf {true|false} command
before specifyClockTree command.

Parameters of checking :
CTS uses following values to determine if diagnostic checks are successful.
Use setCTSMode to change default values.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Pin capacitance check
   Threshold for MaxCap check                     :          90% of constraint (default)

Threshold for MaxBufTran check                    :          180(ps) derived from 90% (default) MaxBufTran constraint
Threshold for MaxSinkTran check                   :          180(ps) derived from 90% (default) MaxSinkTran constraint
Root Input Transition                             :          [207(ps) 135(ps)]



Max Cap Limit Checks
============================================================
**WARN: (IMPCK-6003):	The input capacitance of cell ICP(PAD) is 2.751pF, (timing library IO_CELLS_5V_MOS5ST_typ_1_80V_4_50V_25C is 2.751pF, macro-model definition is 0.000pF), which may make it difficult to meet max buf transition constraint. Number of gated instances having this cell type = 1.

Deep Gating Level Checks
============================================================
** INFO Clock CLK has a maximum of 2 levels of logic before synthesis.

Max placement distance Checks
============================================================
**WARN: (IMPCK-6325):	Found an instance pin IOPADS_INST/PAD_clk_i/PAD on clock CLK that has no availble placement location near it. 
The nearest available placement location to place a buffer is at (260.19,  367.83), which is 64.49 microns away from the pin.
It may be difficult to drive this pin with an acceptable transition time from this location.
Please check and make sure there are availble placement locations near this instance pin.

Root input tran Checks
============================================================
**WARN: (IMPCK-6320):	The root input transition specified at CLK is 207p. This may make it difficult to achieve an acceptable transition time.

**WARN: (SDF-808):	The software is currently operating in a high performance mode which optimizes the handling of multiple timing arcs between input and output pin pairs. With the current settings, the SDF file generated will contain the same delay information for all of these arcs. To have the SDF recalculated with explicit pin pair data, you should use the option '-recompute_parallel_arcs'. This setting is recommended for generating SDF for functional  simulation applications.
